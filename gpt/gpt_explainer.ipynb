    "we'll start with common preprocessing step of tokenizing the data.  This converts the string text into an array of numbers that can be used during the training loop.  I've built a very subtle byte-pair encdoing that has each unique character that appears and the top 5 merges. This keeps our vocab size small and managable for this example. Typically the vocab size is in the 100K+ range. A great library for this is `tiktoken`. Tokenization simply finds the longest pattern of characters that's in common with what was trained and replaces it with an integer that represents it.  This way we turn the text into a numeric array to simplify computing. "

    "2. **Forward Pass** `logits, loss = model(x, y)` - using the data and the model architecture to predict the next token. When training we also compare against the expected to get loss, but in infrerence, we use the logits to complete the inference task.\n",
    "3. **Backward Pass** `loss.backward()` - using differentials to understand what parameters most impact the forward pass' impact on its prediction, comparing that against what is actually right based on the data loading step, and then making very minor adjustments to the impactful parameters with the hope it improves future predictions.

    "Causal self-attention is self-attention with a strictly lower-triangular mask, so each position $i$ can attend only to positions $j≤i$ (no look-ahead). For each position in a sequence, the model decides which earlier tokens matter and blends their information to generate the upcoming token, but the model is not allowed to peek at tokens to the right. Recall that we created an input `x` that has all of the tokens in the sequence. With causal self attention we ensure that the prediction of `y` is not learned in an example from tokens to the right of it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Causal self attention uses 3 linear projections to create representations of 3 concepts to help derive the next token: query, key, and value. FlashAttention takes the input `x` of shape $(B,T,C)$, linearly projects the last dimension to `Q, K, V` by multiplying each token vector $x_{b,t,:}$ with learned weight matrices `Q, K,V` (often via one combined QKV linear) and adding biases (which we do not have. Then we compute the causal dot-product attention with softmax per head, concatenate the heads, and apply a final linear layer to produce the output.  Linear layers use the projection of $y=xA^\\top+b$\n",

    "* **Value** - the payload you actually mix in once something matches. It’s a learned projection of the token’s representation so the model can copy the right kind of information.\n",

    "This layer starts by taking a linear layer that has `n_embd` rows and then  `n_embd` columns for each: the query, key and value.  This allows the projection of the `x_norm` to be split into the 3 components, selected from them. We then use `scaled_dot_product_attention` to provide the attention masking and normalization, including a lower triangle mask to prevent look-ahead, and final project that onto a `n_embd x n_embd` matrix to return the output. \n",

For each head we create its own Q,K,V, compute the causal dot-product attention with softmax per head and then eventually concatenate the heads. During back-propogation, different heads can get updates in different ways based on the examples and gradients.

    "The combination of masked multi-head attention and feed forward, along with the normalization and residual connections is considered the \"transformer\".  In practice this layer is horizontally scaled to run many layers in parallel.  Once those layers are complete during the forward pass we then start the output process that results in `logits` which is a representation of the probability of each token being the next token given the input.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This layer is also known as the model **head**, not to be confused with attention heads. This layer is called this because it is a small, task-specific module attached to a model’s shared backbone that maps hidden features to the final outputs.  In our example case, this is a linear layer mapping the backbone to vocab logits. The benefit of this structure is that you can use the shared hidden features and train different heads for different tasks without starting from scratch. An example would be a classifier head, or policy head in RL.\n",

    "\n",

    "Instead of initializing weights this time around, we'll do **Weight Tying**.  Weight tying sets the output softmax matrix equal to the transpose of the input embedding matrix $W_{\\text{out}} = W_e^\\top$, forcing the model to “read” and “predict” in the same token space. This reduces parameters and acts as a useful prior, improving sample-efficiency and often perplexity by aligning input–output geometry. Modern LLMs have seemed to ditch this though to gain the extra capacity, but, for our example, we'll maintain it.\n",

    "## Learning\n",
    "The process of learning now requires us to update our weights based on this gradient. To really feel the \"back propogation\" we'll start with the last layer and work backwards, though, since we have all of the gradients calculated already, the order does not matter. Recall that our loss function is the negative log likelihood ratio so our gradient signs are flipped.  If a parameter is important, the gradient will be more negaitve, and vice versa. The gradients are a ratio of importance of each parameter and we need to know how much of that gradient to apply to our weights. This \"how much\" is referred to as the *learning rate*.  In modern training learning rate schedulers and optimzers are used to vary the rate and application by layer and by training round.  We'll keep it simple and use an astronomically high learning rate of `1.000` which applies the gradient directly to the weights via a `-=`. Gradient for the weights and the biases is different as the partial differential with respect to each is different. We need to remember in the layers with bias to apply it to both.\n",

Because of this applying loss to the `lm_head` will automatically apply it to `wte`. Since we're doing this manually and not through an optimizer we need to be careful not to apply it twice. Since we're starting with the last layer first, the head, we'll see that the gradients are equal and that updating just the `lm_head` weights updates `wte` weights also."
