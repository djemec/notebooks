    "we'll start with common preprocessing step of tokenizing the data.  This converts the string text into an array of numbers that can be used during the training loop.  We'll use byte-pair-encodging based on the GPT-3 tokenizer in the library `tiktoken` to simplify this process.  Tokenization simply finds the longest pattern of characters that's in common with what was trained and replaces it with an integer that represents it.  This way we turn the text into a numeric array to simplify computing. "
