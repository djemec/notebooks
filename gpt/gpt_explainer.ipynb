    "## Text Prep/Tokenization\n",
    "we'll start with common preprocessing step of tokenizing the data.  This converts the string text into an array of numbers that can be used during the training loop.  I've built a very subtle byte-pair encdoing that has each unique character that appears and the top 5 merges. This keeps our vocab size small and managable for this example. Typically the vocab size is in the 100K+ range. A great library for this is `tiktoken`. Tokenization simply finds the longest pattern of characters that's in common with what was trained and replaces it with an integer that represents it.  This way we turn the text into a numeric array to simplify computing. "

Recall that we created an input `x` that has all of the tokens in the sequence. With causal self attention we ensure that the prediction of `y` is not learned in an example from tokens to the right of it. \n",
